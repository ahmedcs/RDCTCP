# RDCTCP
RDCTCP is a (Virtualized) Receive Window based implementation of DCTCP in data centre networks. 
Specifically, it aims at building a hypervisor based (end-to-end) scheme to enforce DCTCP at the hypervisor level and leverage the performance benefits regardless of the congestion control variant used by the VM. 

It is implemented as a hardware prototype in Linux Kernel as a Load-able Kernel Module and NetFilter framework is used for packet interception.

# Installation Guide
Please Refer to the \[[InstallME](InstallME.md)\] file for more information about installation and possible usage scenarios.

# Running experiments

To run an experiment of DCTCP, install DCTCP on the end-hosts then issue the following:

```
cd experiments
./run_incast.sh 
```
Or to an experiment involving incast and buffer bloating
```
cd experiments
./run_bloat_incast.sh 
```
For more details on the experiments, refer the scripts and adjust them according to your testbed
